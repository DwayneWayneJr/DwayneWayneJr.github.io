## Day 1 Reading

Today we learned about markdown, which is a way to style text on the web. You use regular text and non-alphabetic characters to format the words, add images, or create lists. The website that we use Markdown on is called GitHub. This site uses its own version of Markdown syntax called GitHub Flavored Markdown that makes it easier to work with content on GitHub.

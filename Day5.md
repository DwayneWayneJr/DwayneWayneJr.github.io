## Day 5 Reading

Today we read about color. How to specify the color you want, the terminology you use to understand when deciding the color you want, and contrast. There are three ways to specify the color you want. RGB values, which breaks down the amount of red, blue, or green you want in your color. Hex code which similarly gives red, blue, and green a value, but the value is preceded by a pound sign. Color names are the third way colors are specified, in my opinion this is the least specific way to choose a color, but there are 147 choices. This should at the very least get you in the ball park of the color you want. Hue, saturation, and brightness gives your color a little more life, or dullness depending on what you are going for. For example, a page for a new Batman movie may want to be dull in color choice. It is just the theme of Batman, whereas Toy Story will be lively bright colors. The contrast of your page will want to be easy on the eyes. High to medium contrast is not straining or hard to read. If people canâ€™t read or have to strain to see your content, odds are your page will be skipped over.

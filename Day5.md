## Day 5 Reading

Today was our first readings from out HTML & CSS books. We started out in chapter 18 Process & Design. Process & Design helps you think about why people come to your website. The most important thing I learned from this chapter is Visual Hierarchy. Most people like myself skim websites for the information they need, if it isnâ€™t there or easily viewable we tend to look elsewhere. Site maps and wire frames are your best friend before putting you site on the web. You should go through the planning and mapping phase of your site ten times over just to make sure it visually pleasing to the eye and pertinent information is placed properly.

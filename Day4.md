## Day 4 Reading

Today was our first readings from our HTML & CSS books. We started out in chapter 18 Process and Design. Process & Design helps you think about why people come to your website. The most important thing I learned from this chapter is the term Visual Hierarchy. Most people, like myself, skim through a website to find what it is we are looking for, if it isn't there, we back out and look elsewhere. Site maps and wireframes then become your bestfriend. These allow you to think and plan and update as many times as you need to perfect the vision of your website.

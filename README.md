# It's A Different World

## It's About to go down!
Yo what up, this is my page and I'm just here to change my life.


## Bio
Dwayne's the name and I grew up here in Washington. I was born in Tallahassee, Florida and my family decided to relocate to Washington in 2000. I joined the Army in 2009 and married my wife in 2010. We have a son named Sebastian, and in November or December we will welcome Athena. I love football and basketball, whether playing or watching. You'd catch me at a baseball game before you see me watching a game outside of the playoffs or world series. I enjoy playing video games, but I'm totally a noob so I don't play online. I have played the drums since age 6 or 7 and I played the trombone from middle school into high school. My wife and I are archery hunters and I'd like to think I am a dope bowler. Golf is the next thing I look to ask to my skillset since it is something a lot of my friends do.

## Growth Mindset
Believing that a person's basic abilities can be expanded upon through commintment and hardwork.

### 3 Reminders
1. I am inexperienced.
2. I will take L's.
3. I will bounce back

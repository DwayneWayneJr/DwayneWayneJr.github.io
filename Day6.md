## Day 6 Reading

Today we read about a few basic JavaScript concets. We learned what scripts are and that they contain precise instructions. We also did a follow along that showed us how to link our JavaScript code to our HTML page. The tag named script is used to show where your hava script file is stored.

You must create a variable and give it a neame before you can use it, this is called declaring the variable. After creating the variable and naming it, you can assign it a value by using the equals sign. If this is not done the variable will go undefined. For tasks that involve counting or calculating sums, you must use use numbers, this is called a numeric data type. The string data type consists of characters and symbols. The boolean data type has only two values, true or false. In JavaScript you do not need to specify the type of data your variable will hold.
